        <p class="help-text">Welcome to the Opinion Mining AI app! This app is designed to analyze the sentiment of text data using natural language processing techniques. Here's a brief overview of how to use the app:</p>
        <ul class="help-list">
          <li><strong>Login or Register:</strong> To use the app, you need to either login or register for an account. If you don't have an account, you can register by clicking the "Register" button and providing a username and password. If you already have an account, you can login by providing your username and password.</li>
          <li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Once you are logged in, you will be redirected to the dashboard page. Here, you can upload a text file or enter text manually to analyze its sentiment. The app will display a graph showing the overall sentiment of the text, as well as a breakdown of the sentiment for each sentence in the text.</li>
          <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> The app uses the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on the text. The sentiment score ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), with 0 being neutral. The app also displays the polarity and subjectivity of the text.</li>
          <li><strong>Logout:</strong> To logout, click the "Logout" button in the top right corner of the app. This will clear your session state and redirect you to the login/register page.</li>
